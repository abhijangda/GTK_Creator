GTK_Creator
===========

GTK+ Creator is an IDE for creating C and GTK+ Applications. It is written in C, C++ using GTK+, gtkmm.
The project is still in its initial stage. Although for now it supports following:
1. Creating a C or GTK+ Application using a GUI Interface Designer.
2. Supports code completion.
3. Supports compiling with GNU C Compiler.
4. Supports Auto Indent, Line Numbers etc.
5. Supports Syntax Highlighting.
6. Supports Code Folding.
and many more features will be added. These are:
1. a new full fledged GUI Debugger interfacing GNU Debugger. This debugger will be Inspect, written by me.
2. support for GTK+ 3.0. Current GTK+ Creator supports GTK+ 2.
3. support for GTK+ Code Completion. Currently GTK+ Creator supports some amount of Code Completion for GTK+ but support for GTK+ will be finished.

Just run compile.sh to compile the file to a binary file gtk_creator.
